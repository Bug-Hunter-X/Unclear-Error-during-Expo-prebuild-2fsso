The solution involves carefully reviewing your `package.json` for any issues, such as missing or incompatible dependencies.  Verify all dependencies are correctly installed using `npm install` or `yarn install`. 

Next, check the Expo configuration files (`app.json`, `expo.json`) for any typos or incorrect settings. Ensure they align with the project's requirements. If you're using native modules, double-check if they are correctly configured and linked.  

Finally, consider cleaning and rebuilding the project with `expo prebuild --clean`. This step can resolve problems caused by cached build artifacts.

Example of checking dependencies:
```javascript
npm ls // Check for missing or mismatched versions
```

Example of cleaning the build:
```bash
expo prebuild --clean
```
